# Commentary:
#
# Site-specific customization for Guix.
#
# The program below honors the GUIX_PYTHONPATH environment variable to
# discover Python packages.  File names appearing in this variable that match
# a predefined versioned installation prefix are added to the sys.path.  To be
# considered, a Python package must be installed under the
# 'lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages' directory, where X and Y are the major and
# minor version numbers of the Python interpreter.
#
# Code:
