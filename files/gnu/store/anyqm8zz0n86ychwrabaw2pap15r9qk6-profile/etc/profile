# Source this file to define all the relevant environment variables in Bash
# for this profile.  You may want to define the 'GUIX_PROFILE' environment
# variable to point to the "visible" name of the profile, like this:
#
#  GUIX_PROFILE=/path/to/profile ; \
#  source /path/to/profile/etc/profile
#
# When GUIX_PROFILE is undefined, the various environment variables refer
# to this specific profile generation.

export PATH="${GUIX_PROFILE:-/gnu/store/anyqm8zz0n86ychwrabaw2pap15r9qk6-profile}/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH"
